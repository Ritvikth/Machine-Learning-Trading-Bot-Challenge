## Comparing Models

![SVM Model](Strategy_Returns_vs._Actual_Returns_Using_SVM_Learning.PNG)

![AdaBoost Model](Strategy_Returns_vs._Actual_Returns_Using_AdaBoost_Learning.PNG)

The AdaBoost model has been more volatile than the SVM model but both models performed approximately the same at in terms of returns in the end. The returns were slightly higher with the tuned model of AdaBoost than the SVM leaning toward 1.6
